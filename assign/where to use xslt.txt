Don't have to write in the actual XML
- If it writes to the temp xml
- Have to be able to show the xml directly
- Do have to use XSLT to:
	- make a booking, (this is added to a users booked flights)
	- 
	- cancel a booking, 
	- and the admin roles in regards to bookings

- User views their booked flights (also displayed when they want to cancel a flight)

- When an admin wants to view a list of all of people's booked flights
	- XSLT also displays A button that links to a cancel page
